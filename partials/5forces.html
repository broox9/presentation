    <div id="force-box">
        <div id="rivalries" class="main-force">
            <h5>Existing Rivalries</h5>
            <p>
                Medium. No direct competitors but substitutes are currently very popular
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="entrants" class="force">
            <h5>Threat of New Entrants</h5>
            <p>
                Very high due to low cost of entry into the market and a good amount of people with domain knowledge of the customer
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="supplier" class="force">
            <h5>Supplier Power</h5>
            <p>
                Low. Hosting, developers, and smart phones are all in competitive markets themselves.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="buyer" class="force">
            <h5>Buyer Power</h5>
            <p>
                High/Very High, especially initially.  Existing rivalry is high and threat of substitute is high so a balance of pricing and convenience must be found.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="substitutes" class="force">
            <h5>Threat of Substitutes</h5>
            <p>
                High. Churches use social media sites like Facebook and twitter currently, and there are a lot of bible apps
                on the market today.
